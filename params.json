Most features outside of Mapping \r\nare not yet implemented past some prototype data models. \r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n-----------\r\nEve W-Space is, at its core, a wormhole mapping and intel tool for the MMORPG \r\nEve Online. If you wish, it can be much more. It can be customized to fill \r\nroles from simple mapping applicaiton (with all extra features disabled) to \r\nthe centerpiece of an entire alliance services infrastructure.\r\n\r\nEve W-Space is designed to be a single-tenant soulution hosted by a single corp \r\nor alliance. A fleixble permissions system allows for easily restricting data \r\nwhere needed.\r\n\r\nHow do I use it?\r\n----------------\r\nGenerally, Eve W-Space requires:\r\n\r\n* Django 1.4+\r\n* Python 2.7+\r\n* Celery\r\n* RabbitMQ (preferred)\r\n* memcached (preferred)\r\n* mySQL (preferred, should work with Postgres as well)\r\n\r\nOther required python modules are listed in requirements.txt.\r\n\r\nHow Eve W-Space is installed will depend on the environment, a sample Puppet \r\nmanifest (based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Nginx, and Gunicorn) and scripts are \r\nprovided in the puppet/sample directory to get you started while proper \r\ndocumentation is lacking.\r\n\r\nFor quick testing and hacking, a Vagrantfile is provided to get up and running \r\nquickly, the manifest used by the Vagrant VM does not automatically install a web \r\nserver.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38534563-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
